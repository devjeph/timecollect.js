* **Data Transformation** : Cleans, structures, and aggregates timesheet entries into a single dataset.
* **Excel Report Generation** : Creates a `.xlsx` file from the processed data using `exceljs`.
* **Google Drive Integration** : Automatically uploads the final report to a designated Google Drive folder, updating the existing file if it's already there.
* **Web Interface** : A simple UI with a single button to trigger the entire process and a log panel to monitor progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend** : Node.js, Express.js
* **APIs** : Google Sheets API v4, Google Drive API v3
* **Key Libraries** :
